Snowflake Catcher
================

In this assignment you will create a class to model a single snow flake. Then you will create an array of many snowflakes.



Steps to completing the program (These are just a suggested starting point. Feel free to adjust them anyway you'd like):

Clone and fork the SnowFlakeCatcher repository

Add the following to the SnowFlake class. 

2 member integer variables: x and y
1 member boolean variable: isMoving
The constructor should initialize the members as follows:
x: random integer from 0 to 300 (or whatever the width of the screen is)
y: random integer from 0 to 300 (or whatever the height of the screen is)
isMoving: true
void erase() which first, sets the fill to black and draws a black ellipse of size 7 at (x,y)
void move() which checks if the snow flake isMoving. If it is, increase y by one
void lookDown() checks if y is between the top and bottom of the screen, and the position just below (x,y) is not black. If so, set isMoving to false; otherwise set isMoving to true 
void show() which draws a white ellipse of size 5 at x,y
void wrap() which checks if the y coordinate is off the bottom of the screen. If it is, set y to 0 and generate a new random x coordinate
Now create an array of SnowFlakes. In draw write a loop that goes through the array and for each snow flake does the following:

erase()
lookDown()
move()
wrap()
show()
In mouseDragged() write some code that draws to the screen. When you are happy with your assignment, push your repository to your GitHub account. Submit the url of your working program to the school loop drop box. 

Note: I got the idea for this assignment after looking at a video of 
Francis Lam's snow flower program
